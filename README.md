## Introduction

This was a project whose base code and inspiration comes from the React course on codeCademy as part of the Full Stack Engineer course.

## Aims
The aim of the course is to improve my react and redux skills and how to utilise specific libraries utilised often in them. I applied this to create an interface where 
you can add topics that you wish to study, and then you can add quizzes based on these topics, and then finally you can add cards to these quizzes with both front and 
back card descriptions respectively.

## How to access the project

+ Fork the repository
+ Download dependencies with:
```bash
 npm install
 ```
+ Then initiate a development server with:
```bash 
npm start
```

## Skills utilised

This project utilised primarily react-redux and react-toolkit, utilising hooks and slices to create an appointment planner which contains topics, quizzes associated to
the topics and cards associated to both quizzes.
